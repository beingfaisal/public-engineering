Hi :wave: Do you need help with Open edX? We would like to suggest that you move your question to the official Open edX community forum, which is very active: https://discuss.openedx.org Please take the time to add as many details as you can, including plaintext logs, urls and screenshots. As a rule of thumb, you should not expect people to put more energy in answering your question than you did in writing it. Also, add your topic to the correct category and with the correct tags, such that other people in the community can be notified. Slack is primarily used for coordination of working groups and focused conversations, not Open edX help questions. See you there!
